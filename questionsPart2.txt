questions for data com project:

Do we need to store the entire resource record, or just the name, ip and ttl

We are not storing this as an array of bits.  We will use structures to store the RR's

Do we need to store every resource record, for example every singe answer, or is one good enough
	We need to store all of them

is using a map<string fullname, struct resourceRecord> a good method?
	Kinda

when do we check the TTLs of the resource records? every time we check them?
	Yes. Every time	

where is the name of the intermediate servers, for example .com .co.uk...
it is in the authorative nameservers, 
	It is in authoratative nameservers... but it should be the same for all of them. So we can just grab the name from one of them and the store it


can we send the 2 byte name in additional resources to "decode name" to get
the subname? test this would need to pass the begining of the
	?
